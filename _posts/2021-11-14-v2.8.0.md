We're pleased to announce Ergo v2.8.0, a new stable release. For the official binary release and changelog, see our GitHub:

[https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/releases/tag/v2.8.0](https://github.com/oragono/oragono/releases/tag/v2.8.0)

As part of this release, our official Docker images have moved from Docker Hub to the GitHub Container Registry, at `ghcr.io/ergochat/ergo`. The `stable` and `master` tags correspond to the respective branches. Tagged releases (e.g. `v2.8.0`) are available under the corresponding named tags.
