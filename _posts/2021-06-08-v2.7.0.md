We're pleased to announce Ergo v2.7.0, the first stable release under our new name. For the official binary release and changelog, see our GitHub:

[https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/releases/tag/v2.7.0](https://github.com/oragono/oragono/releases/tag/v2.7.0)

We're still working on fully transitioning our website to its new address at [ergo.chat](https://ergo.chat), but you can expect a final news post here with details when it happens.
