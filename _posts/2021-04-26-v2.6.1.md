Oragono 2.6.1 is a bugfix release that fixes a security issue, introduced in 2.4.0. This issue may be critical for some private server configurations (i.e., Internet-facing servers that are not open to the public). We apologize for the oversight.

For the official binary releases and more details, including effective mitigations, see our GitHub page:
