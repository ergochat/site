We're pleased to announce v2.1.0, a new stable release building on feedback from real-world operators and end users. Highlights include:

* Native support for websockets contributed by [@hhirtz](https://github.com/hhirtz), eliminating the need for a separate websockets-to-IRC proxy server
* Tighter control over the relationship between account names and nicknames, eliminating the need for extbans
* Support for sending account verification emails directly from Oragono, including DKIM signatures

For the official binary releases and a more complete changelog, see our GitHub page:
