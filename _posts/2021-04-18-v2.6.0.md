We're pleased to announce v2.6.0, a new stable release. Highlights include:

* A new CHATHISTORY API for listing direct message conversations
* The latest proposal for IRC-over-websockets, which should be backwards-compatible with existing clients
* The latest specification for the bot usermode (`+B` in our implementation)
